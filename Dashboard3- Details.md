# Bank Loan Report-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive Financial Domain project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including Data preprocessing, Data cleaning, and Data visualization. 

## Dashboard 3: Details

In our Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
Objective:

The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
